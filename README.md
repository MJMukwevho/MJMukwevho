My name is Mukwevho Mukovhe Justice, a data enthusiast. My
goal is to tell the story hidden within the messy datasets, and
to help realize every dataset potential of bringing insights for
better decision making within businesses and organizations.
I am problem solver, at times I do have a sense that I am the
worlds best, other times I just feel that I am indeed the worlds best

  <h1>Some of my interesting repos </h1>
  <ul>
  <li> <h2>MD Python:</h2> </li>
    Here we build a physical system for studying interaction of particles under the Leornard Jones potential. This was done for
    Statistical Mechanics graduate class.

  <li> <h2> Random Walk</h2>  </li>
  Faced with a decision of choosing where to go in a two dimensional world, why not let this random walker assist in getting you home?
  This is a simple random walker based on Bernoulli decision making function.
  <li> <h2> Group 19 JHB</h2></li>
  A utility package created when doing a sprint for EDSA. Most of the functions are for natural language processing</ul>
